                <h5>
                    Designed to stop texting and driving, ttyl will
                    automatically send responses to anyone who contacts
                    you while you're using google maps to navigate.
                    The automatic response will inform the person that
                    you're driving, and include your estimated
                    time of arrival.
                </h5>

                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <h5>
                    To use this application, simply indicate when you start
                    your trip. If "driving" is activated, the app will automatically
                    respond to your contacts and let them know you can't respond currently.
                    It will look like this:
                    <br><br>
                    "Your name" is currently driving! They will respond to your
                    message when they arrive at their destination.
